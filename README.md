# N8n-Workflows

This repository serves as a backup location for workflows exported from my self-hosted [n8n](https://n8n.io/) instance. All workflows in this repository are regularly exported and stored here to ensure version control, easy recovery, and sharing of automation processes.

- **Purpose:** Backup and version control for n8n workflows.
- **Source:** Workflows are exported from a private, self-hosted n8n instance.
- **Structure:** Each workflow is stored in the [`workflows/`](workflows/README.md) directory.

Feel free to browse the workflows or use them as references for your own automation needs. Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome.
